# ObjC2J #

ObjC2J is an open-source library tool that translates Objective-C (Mac OS X) code to Java for the PC platform. The goal is to translate an app's written in Objective-C with UI code to JVM platform (and Android JVM in future).

ObjC2J is currently in development stage. It can now nearly translate non-UI Objective-C code into Java classes, including categories and other ObjC-features.
~~For translation MacOSX10.x SDK is needed.~~

This project is developed in pair with [jCocoa](http://code.google.com/p/jcocoa/) project: we strongly need to use basic Cocoa ports even for translating elementary Objective-C programs.

To start with ObjC2J refer to wiki ["Usage" page](http://code.google.com/p/objc2j/wiki/Usage)
